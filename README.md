# 🧪 NopCommerce Automation Testing Project

This project demonstrates end-to-end automation testing for the [nopCommerce](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/) web application using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestNG**. It follows best practices including the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, **data-driven testing**, and modular utility handling.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **pages/** – Page Object Model classes for all tested pages  
- **tests/** – Test classes with TestNG annotations  
- **utilities/** – Reusable utility classes (e.g., WebDriver setup, waits, screenshots)  
- **data/** – Test data sources (used via `@DataProvider`)  
- **runner.xml** – TestNG suite configuration file

---

## 🚀 Features

- Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable code  
- Data-driven testing using `@DataProvider`  
- Utility classes for browser actions, waits, and logging  
- Organized and scalable test execution with TestNG XML  
- Assertions for validation and verification steps
